# ASH

ASH is a crypto-currency built from scratch. 

My goals with this project are as follows:

* **Mining**: Miners can join/leave the mining network without any configuration on a central node.
* **Wallets**: Users can send coins from one wallet to another.
* **Security**: Basic security.

A lot of this project is based on [this Javascript tutorial](https://lhartikk.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/07/15/chapter0.html). However this project uses C++ (as of the writing of this I am using C++17, but hope to switch to C++20 soon).

**NOTE**: This implementation is simply a fun project to help me learn more about blockchains and crypto currency. **I am by no means an expert in either**.
