# ASH

ASH is my attempt to build a crypto-currency from scratch. My goals with this project are as follows:

* **Mining**: Miners can join/leave the mining network without any configuration on a central node.
* **Wallets**: Users can send coins from one wallet to another.
* **Security**: Basic security (TBD)

A lot of this will be based on [this Javascript tutorial](https://lhartikk.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/07/15/chapter0.html). However this project will be implemented in C++.

**NOTE**: My knowledge of crypto currency is very basic. This project is meant only as a proof-of-concept to myself that I can implement the project as I vision it in my mind.
